Zabbix 3.4 Dell Equallogic
==========================

This template (ZBX3-DELL-EQUALLOGIC) uses the Equallogic-MIB to discover and manage Equallogic Storage Arrays in Zabbix 3.2.

This Zabbix template provides a check of Dell Equallogic systems.
The template has been tested on a several systems: 

* PS4100
* PS6510
* PS5500
* PS6500
* PS-M4110
* PS6110XS
* P6110XV
* PS6110E

Contents
--------

* zbx3-dell-equallogic.xml - Zabbix template

Installation
------------

Import the XML file into Zabbix (Under Configuration -> Templates).

The SNMP Community string for the template can be set in the template configuration itself, under Macros. By default this is set to: "public".

Run the following command on the console:

```
snmpwalk -v2c -c <COMMUNITY-STRING> <EQL-IP> .1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.2.1.1.1.9.1

```

For example:

```
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 123.456.798.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.12740.2.1.1.1.9.1

```

You will get something like this:

```
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.12740.2.1.1.1.9.1.1234567890 = STRING: "Foo"
                                          ----------            -----------
                                          {$EQL_ID}             {$EQL_NAME}
```
If you get multiple results, i.e. if you extended your storage by additional units, you can create multiple
hosts for any discovered subsystem with the same snmp hostname.

Now create/overload a macro on the Host:
```
{$EQL_ID} -> 1234567890
{$EQL_NAME} -> Foo
{$SNMP_COMMUNITY} -> public
```

We need that because zabbix has no nested LLD at the moment, please vote for it https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBXNEXT-1527

Value Mappings

Starting from Zabbix 3.0 these are imported with the XML template. With earlier versions of Zabbix you need to create these manually in the servers administration.
